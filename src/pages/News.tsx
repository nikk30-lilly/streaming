            <p>
              SPI&rsquo;s FilmBox has built up a large fan base in the
              Netherlands since its launch in May this year. This is reflected
              in the SKO Light reports, which include the channel as of November
              14<sup>th</sup>, 2021. In the first week of the measurement,
              FilmBox got off to a good start with 210,000 viewers, which grew
              further in the second week to 263,000 viewers (target group 6+).
              The channel currently reaches approximately 600,000 households via
              eight Dutch TV platforms and has enormous potential with an
              expansion of distribution. SPI International expects to expand
              FilmBox&#39;s market position in the short term. As a result of
              the growth, SPI is joining forces with sales house Bionic Media,
              which has been representing FilmBox since mid-November.
