              Chef topped the charts this month. The movie follows Favreu as
              Carl Casper, a head chef who quits his restaurant job and buys a
              food truck in an effort to reclaim his creative promise, while
              piecing back together his estranged family. This movie is perfect

              heartwarming movie, including Robert Downey Jr. Scarlett
              Johansson, Dustin Hoffman, John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara.
              Another piece of trivia that&rsquo;s enough to make your mouth
              water is that Favreu did his own cooking in the movie by training
              with food truck chef Roy Choi. Choi sent Favreu to a week of

                Sometimes the best way to learn about a country is to eat your
                way around it. As an impatient Sagittarius with the travel bug
                running laps in my system, I love exploring new cultures through
                their local delicacies and cuisines. That&rsquo;s why food and
                travel series such as <strong>Max&nbsp;Foodie </strong>on{" "}

                In Buddhism, the human mind is described as a drunken monkey
                running wildly within six windows - five of which represent our
                sensory impressions and the sixth that stands for our mental
                state, including our thoughts and memories. The monkey is all
                over the place and with meditation practice the meditator can
                learn to tame the monkey and elevate his concentration. If you
                are curious about the concrete effects of meditation on the
